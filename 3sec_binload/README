I wrote this back in the 80s.  Or at least modified it.  It's a tiny
menu-based binary-load program that fits in the three boot sectors,
allowing you to completely fill a standard DOS 2 or DOS 2.5 disk with
games.

I don't remember the details, but I based this on other longer menu
programs.

The MENU.000 and MENU.ASM files are for use with the Assembler Editor
cartridge.  I've also included ASCII conversions.

I don't remember why there are two versions.  The .000 file looks like a
disassembly.

The file "bootsectors" are the raw 3 boot sectors (384 bytes).  I used my
disassembler on it to produce the "bootsectors.disasm" file.
